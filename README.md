part1.py Spatial Index creation
part2.py Range-Search Window Selection. We use the grid we created in part1.py to evaluate window selection queries. The program will take as command-line arguments the lower and upper bound of the window in each dimension,
e.g values <x_low> <x_high> <y_low> <y_high>. It should calculate and print the points included in the window.
